## What is this?
AI-visualizer is a small tool written using pygame, that aims to show the inner workings of AI-Neurons using an abstract, dataset-like simulation.

## Installation
Clone the project to your computer using git clone or by downloading it as a zip file. Then run the main.py file using
```python path/to/your/main.py```

## Controls
In the bottom right, there are two sliders, which you can use to move the red line in the middle, like a linear function.<br>

When pressing s, you can toggle an overlay, showing what data the red line is seperating.<br>
